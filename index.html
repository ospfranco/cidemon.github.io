        "Having a unobtrusive reminder of CI status is extremely useful. While
        email or slack notifications might be great for important build
        notifications, I find this is so much better for getting updates on
        feature branches that don't need my immediate attention. It's also so
        much faster than going to a bookmarked CI page in your browser, finding
        the build, and waiting for slow interfaces to load."
