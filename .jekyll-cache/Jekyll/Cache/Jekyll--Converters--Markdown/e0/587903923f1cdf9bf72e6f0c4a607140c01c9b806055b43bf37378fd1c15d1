I"k<p>Starting somewhere last year, something happened to the terminal on bigsur, on every clean start up it would hang for many seconds until the prompt was there.</p>

<p>There are some people who have found some solutions, I tried all of them until it <strong>something</strong> worked, so here is a compilation for you to try as well.</p>

<h2 id="xcode-tools">Xcode tools</h2>

<p>For some the problem seemed to be they did not accept the license:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>xcodebuild <span class="nt">-license</span> accept
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Related to this, could be that the command line tools are not properly installed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the interest of time this is what seemed to have worked for me</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo rm</span> <span class="nt">-rf</span> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
<span class="nb">sudo </span>xcode-select <span class="nt">--install</span>
<span class="nb">sudo </span>xcode-select <span class="nt">-switch</span> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-git-via-brew">Install git via brew</h2>

<p>For some the problem seems to be the integrated git version, replace it via brew:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew <span class="nb">install </span>git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-zsh-via-brew">Install zsh via brew</h2>

<p>Others report that the zsh version that comes with mac is old, replace it with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew <span class="nb">install </span>zsh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="try-messing-with-nvm">Try messing with NVM</h2>

<p>One user reports having a nvm default alias caused the issue for him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tried all Google results and nothing works. Eventually, I found it was caused by setting Node.js v8.x as default in nvm, alias default to system will resolve the issue. Although I don’t know why nvm need to run xcodebuild for Node.js v8.x.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="debug-your-zshrc-or-zprofile-script">Debug your .zshrc (or .zprofile) script</h2>

<p>Sometimes the slowdown could be caused by some extra step, I had a different problem with one of the apps I use, you can see what happens when you start a zsh session with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>zsh <span class="nt">-i</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> <span class="nt">-x</span> <span class="nb">exit</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I ended up trying a bunch of things here, disabling some plugins, nvm, trying to lazy load components</p>

<h2 id="check-the-multiple-files-that-zsh-loads">Check the multiple files that zsh loads</h2>

<p>Zsh loads a lot of files for configuration, it could be possible (not in my case), that some of this is poorly configured, worth a try if you already tried everything above:</p>

<p>https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/</p>

<p>Hopefully this will solve your problem, mine was fixed somewhere between installing zsh via brew and re-installing the xcode-tools</p>
