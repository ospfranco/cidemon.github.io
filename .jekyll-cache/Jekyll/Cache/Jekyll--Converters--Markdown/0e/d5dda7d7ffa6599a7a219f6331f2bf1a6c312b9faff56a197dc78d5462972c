I"f<p>I am a (painfully) average developer. I do not make millions. I have not created complex trading algorithms, programs or businesses. I have a good yet average paying job. My group of friends are (in the nicest way possible) as average as I am, none of us has reached massive success, some might have stocks, but <strong>we work for a living.</strong></p>
